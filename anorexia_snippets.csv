4	1120	uiug.30112114890558	that each patient should be dieted according to his condition , so that it may happen that one will receive a limited supply of solid food of a specified character almost throughout the attack , whilst another may not be able to resume solid food until convalescence is far advanced

7	1302	uiug.30112114890558	of effect , of each change . Practically , therefore , the change consists solely in altering the time at which a trial with solid food may be made from the tenth day of convalescence to any period during or after the attack when the patient 's wishes and our
8	1411	uiug.30112114890558	absence of ravenous hunger , from the earlier satisfying of legitimate cravings , is itself one of the best safeguards against an inclination to bolt food . At the same time if the habit is firmly rooted I have combated it by having the meat previously minced or chopped .

14	183	uiug.30112114890558	pyrexia , with the result , as I think , that the fever has immediately subsided or pursued its further course quite independently of the food given . Then as regards a relapse . This is generally admitted to be the result of a re- infection , so that it
15	253	uiug.30112114890558	that since during or after an attack of enteric fever the bile may not unfrequently be crowded with the specific bacilli the administration of solid food by increasing the flow of bile may as a result increase the number of bacilli poured into the intestine and thus be instrumental in

Quite recently Dr. John Madden , criticising Professor Attwater's teaching on the food value of alcohol , pointed out that it differed from fats and carbohydrates in so far that it was a violent protoplasmic poison whilst
113	753	uiug.30112114890558	as a nutrient substance . Dr. Madden pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to show that alcohol might act as a respira- tory food or that it was converted into a reserve supply of fat , but that instead of protecting nitrogenous tissues from undue waste ( as
114	806	uiug.30112114890558	and carbohydrates ) , alcohol actually hastened their waste , acting as a protoplasmic poison . Another important feature in connexion with alcohol as a food was the extraordinary avidity that it , like phosphorus , appeared to have for oxygen . This was probably one of the rime factors
115	1674	uiug.30112114890558	alcohol increased the susceptibility of the tissues to this infection or interf with the production of immunity it could scarcely be good as a permanent food substance in this disease .

Apart from cases where litiga- tion is in question the medical officer has frequently a difficult and delicate duty to perform . On
